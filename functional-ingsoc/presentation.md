# War is peace

## Non-functional programming

- It's great to be able to write 'intuitive' code without interference from the
  language!

- Convenient when you're writing your program, not so much when you have to run
  it.

## Functional programming

- If there's any way for my mistake to be caught at compile time, I will find
  it and use it.

- The compiler will declare all-out war on your program but when the dust
  settles, you have the peace of mind that it will do what you expect.

# Freedom is slavery

## Non-functional programming

- It's so great that your functions are unrestricted in what they can do and
  you can just focus on writing your code!

- Easy to write the first time, nearly impossible to change afterwards because
  you are bound by past decisions.

## Functional programming

- Let's limit the scope of what each function can do so that we can easily make
  changes later, as we inevitably will.

- Not as easy to write the first time, but much easier to change afterwards

# Ignorance is strength

## Non-functional programming

- How good is not having to worry about purity and compositionality?

- Slow, hard to analyze, full of bugs

## Functional programming

- How good is polymorphism (parametric, arbitrary-rank, levity, linearity, etc.)?

- Constraints liberate and liberties constrain (thanks RÃºnar)

# Doublethink

## What!?

- the acceptance of contrary opinions or beliefs at the same time, especially
  as a result of political indoctrination.

- I'd describe myself as extremely enthusiastic about FP, but not so long
  ago...

# What's my point???

## Radicalisation

- My dynamically-typed programs failed over and over and over and over again

- There was a supportive, friendly FP community in the city I was living in

- The code I wrote was immediately better and more robust, even before tests

- It was still painful, and I wonder if there is an easier way.

## Empathy

- There's definitely a period of adjustment when learning to 'think
  functionally' and it does us no harm to be nicer to those who are trying

- Maybe there are more palatable ways to sell Haskell, rather than the
  justifications we use now

## Thanks!
